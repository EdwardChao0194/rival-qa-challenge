/*
Todo component sample pseudo code test:
Test 1:
I would render the Todo component and check that the text decoration style is set to none by default

Test 2:
I would render the Todo component and check that users are able to enter a string into the input box

Test 3:
After entering a string into the input box, I would verify that users are able to add a string into the todo list

Test 4: 
After adding an item to the todo list, I would verify that the item appears on the 'All' and 'Active' lists

Test 5:
After adding an item to the todo list, I would verify that click on the item will remove the item from the 'Active' list and into the 'Completed' and 'All' list with a strikethrough attribute.

Add a few more tests below that you think help verify the logic and expected behaviour. 
Do not over test.
